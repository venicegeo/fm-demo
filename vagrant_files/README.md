# Vagrant

If using geoshape-vagrant, overwrite the existing files, with these new configuration files prior to calling vagrant up for the first time.

This will create an additional 500GB drive on the VM to accomodate large fulcrum data sets. The drive be default will be stored with your vagrant scripts not with the VM. 

If this is too large or the drive needs to be in a different location you should edit the values before calling vagrant up the first time.
